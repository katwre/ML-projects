# ML-projects

A collection of my machine learning mini-projects exploring deep learning and data science methods, including:
- **Autoencoders** for dimensionality reduction and data imputation (autoencoder_scRNA-seq)
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for image classification tasks based on chest X-rays (CNN_and_TransferLearning_Xray)
- **Transfer learning** using pre-trained models (CNN_and_TransferLearning_Xray)
- **Survival analysis** with clinical and gene expression data (survival_analysis_multiple_myeloma)
- Minimal **federated learning workflow** to compute a weighted mean of the per-site gene variances to identify the most variable genes (federated_learning_minimal)
- **Variational autoencoder** approach to mitigate batch effects in scRNA-seq using **federated learning** simulations (federated_learning_scRNA-seq)
